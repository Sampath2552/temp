Throughout the year, I consistently focused on writing clean, readable, and maintainable code across all technologies I worked with, including Java, Spring Boot, Node.js, React, and Electron. I followed standard naming conventions, modularized my code, and applied design principles like DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) and SOLID where applicable. I used meaningful variable and function names, added proper inline comments, and structured code for better readability and future maintenance. In Java and Spring Boot, I ensured separation of concerns using layered architecture, and in React, I used reusable components and followed proper state management practices. I also actively participated in code reviews, incorporating feedback to further improve code quality. These practices have helped me produce code that is easy to understand, test, and enhance, contributing to overall project stability and team collaboration.
