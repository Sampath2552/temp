Over the past year, I have focused on clear and concise communication in both verbal and written forms. During team discussions, I actively listened to feedback, paid attention to non-verbal cues, and adapted my responses accordingly. While working on cross-functional tasks involving frontend, backend, and deployment teams, I clearly articulated technical ideas, raised blockers early, and ensured everyone was aligned. I also documented key solutions, created walkthroughs, and influenced decision-making by presenting structured information that supported project goals effectively.
