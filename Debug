During my first year at TCS, I actively practiced debugging and optimizing code across different technologies like Java, Spring Boot, Node.js, and React. I used debugging tools in IDEs like IntelliJ and VS Code to trace issues, identify bottlenecks, and resolve runtime errors. I applied logging best practices using Log4j and console-based debugging for both backend and frontend code. In optimization, I focused on reducing code complexity, minimizing API response times, and improving frontend rendering using Reactâ€™s memoization and lazy loading. I also refactored inefficient loops, improved database queries, and applied pagination and caching where necessary. These efforts enhanced application performance and reliability. Regular performance testing and peer feedback helped me identify and fix issues early, leading to efficient and maintainable code throughout the development lifecycle.
