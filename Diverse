During my time at TCS, I have worked in diverse teams where I valued and respected individual and group differences in communication styles, cultural backgrounds, and perspectives. I actively listened to ideas from all team members, promoted inclusive discussions, and encouraged collaboration regardless of role or background. Iâ€™ve seen firsthand how diverse thinking leads to more innovative and effective solutions. I supported a fair and respectful work environment by being mindful of diversity policies and ensuring everyone had equal opportunity to contribute. This inclusive approach helped improve team performance and trust.
