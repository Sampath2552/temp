Throughout the year, I consistently took initiative to meet work objectives without waiting for direction. I proactively addressed frontend and backend issues, often identifying and fixing potential problems before they escalated. I took ownership of tasks beyond my immediate role, including performance optimization and implementing UI improvements in Electron apps. I regularly volunteered ideas to improve code quality and team efficiency, and was willing to lead their implementation. My willingness to take on new responsibilities and explore better ways of working helped the team deliver smoother and more reliable solutions.
