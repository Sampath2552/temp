Over the past year, I have focused on delivering original solutions by questioning existing processes and exploring more efficient alternatives. While working on frontend projects with React and Electron, I introduced reusable components and optimized state management to improve performance. I also experimented with Vite for faster build times and suggested integrating modern UI patterns using MUI. On the backend, I explored different API optimization techniques in Spring Boot. I consistently looked for ways to enhance user experience and team productivity through automation and smarter tooling, contributing to more innovative and effective outcomes.
