Throughout my first year at TCS, I maintained a strong focus on continuous learning to stay updated with emerging technologies. I completed certifications in AWS, Azure, and ServiceNow, which enhanced my understanding of cloud platforms and IT service management. These certifications helped me apply cloud concepts effectively in real-world scenarios. Additionally, Iâ€™ve started learning DevOps practices, including CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and infrastructure automation, which are crucial for modern development workflows. I regularly explore new tools and frameworks, and stay informed through documentation, tech forums, and hands-on practice. This learning mindset has improved my technical versatility and allowed me to contribute more meaningfully to diverse projects and cross-functional discussions. I plan to continue expanding my knowledge to stay aligned with industry trends.
