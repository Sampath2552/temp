During my first year at TCS, I developed a structured approach to problem-solving by analyzing issues thoroughly and breaking them into smaller, manageable parts. For instance, while resolving performance lags in a React-Electron app, I examined component rendering, API response times, and backend logic in Spring Boot to identify the root cause. I considered the impact of proposed fixes on both users and teams, ensuring solutions were sustainable. I involved relevant stakeholders—such as QA, backend, and UI teams—throughout the process, ensuring transparency and smooth implementation. This helped in delivering well-rounded and effective solutions.
