During my first year at TCS, I focused on understanding and using version control tools, with a primary emphasis on SVN. I gained hands-on experience using TortoiseSVN for tasks like checkout, commit, update, creating branches, and resolving conflicts. I learned how SVN manages centralized repositories and how to collaborate effectively in such an environment. Alongside SVN, I also explored Git and GitHub. I practiced essential Git commands like clone, commit, push, pull, and merge, and understood how distributed version control works. On GitHub, I used features such as branches, pull requests, and issues to manage code collaboratively. This dual experience with both SVN and Git helped me understand the strengths of centralized and distributed systems, improved my collaboration skills, and ensured better code management across different tools used in projects
