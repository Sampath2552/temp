Throughout the year, I have actively contributed to building a collaborative and trusting team environment. I encouraged open discussions during stand-ups and review meetings, ensuring everyoneâ€™s ideas were heard and valued. I willingly supported teammates by sharing knowledge, reviewing code, and helping resolve technical blockers in both frontend and backend areas. Whether working on React components, debugging Electron issues, or integrating Spring Boot APIs, I collaborated closely with peers to ensure smooth delivery. This open communication and team-first mindset helped us achieve project goals efficiently and maintain a positive working atmosphere.
