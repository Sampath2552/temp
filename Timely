During my first year at TCS, I made timely and impactful decisions by balancing risks and benefits, especially in high-pressure or uncertain scenarios. For example, while selecting tools for a new frontend module, I evaluated trade-offs between traditional setups and Vite, ultimately choosing Vite for its faster build performance after a quick feasibility check. I used both structured analysis and intuitive judgment when exact data wasnâ€™t available, especially in fast-moving project phases. I considered the impact on users, performance, and team capacity, and involved relevant stakeholders before finalizing key decisions, ensuring alignment and minimizing risks.
