Over the past year at TCS, I focused on writing unit test cases and fixing bugs early, with more emphasis on frontend and Electron apps. I used Jest and React Testing Library to test React components, covering props, state changes, and user interactions. In Electron, I validated communication between renderer and main processes and ensured UI behavior was stable across different OS environments. Debugging tools in VS Code and Chrome DevTools helped me quickly trace and fix issues. I resolved most bugs during development, reducing defect leakage. On the backend, I used JUnit and Mockito in Spring Boot to test service layers and REST APIs. Timely bug fixing and proper test coverage improved app quality and user experience. This proactive approach helped in delivering stable, maintainable applications on time.
