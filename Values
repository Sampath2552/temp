Throughout my journey at TCS, I have made decisions and taken actions that align with the company’s core values and code of conduct. I consistently demonstrated integrity by being transparent in communication, meeting commitments, and ensuring quality in all deliverables. While pursuing results, I remained accountable for my work and upheld ethical standards, especially in situations involving sensitive data or client-facing components. I respected team norms, adhered to project guidelines, and ensured my actions contributed positively to the organization’s reputation and trust. Responsibility and ethics remained at the core of my work approach.
